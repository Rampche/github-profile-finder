This is the project i've made to the Web Development course from Etic. I used React with typescript, the page system of React Router, and the Tailwind Css library. 

The main goal of the app, until now, is to allow you to find users of the GitHub. In the development, i used Axios, with a try/catch system to fetch the data.
